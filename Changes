[Changes for 0.02 - 2004-10-17]

* Path matching logic now actually works.
* Fix ${revision} interpolation in config values, so
  '/tmp/tarball-${revision}.tgz' would work.
* Allow variables with dashes, such as ${with-diff}.
* Factor out ->new, ->prepare and ->execute, and move the exit() call
  inside ->import so this module may be used programmatically.
* Add README and Changes.
